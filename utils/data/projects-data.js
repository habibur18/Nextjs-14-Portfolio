I approached a local IT company (Youth Instructory) that had built their e-learning platform using WordPress, but it was quite slow. They asked me to build a clone of the Domestika website, as they wanted a similar site for themselves. That's why I completed this project in 3-4 days, using React.js and Tailwind CSS to create the Domestika clone. However, they eventually decided to stop the project.",
